<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Maksim Bolonkin, and I am a Sr. Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Motorola Solutions.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of classes I have taught in the past under the <a href="/teaching">Teaching</a> tab.<br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. Some of my blog posts in which I share what I learned or found interesting can be found <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
