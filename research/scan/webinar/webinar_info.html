                    The talk will start with a brief introduction to the Socio-Cultural Attitudinal Networks (SCAN) project – a joint effort 
                    by Dartmouth College, Rutgers University, Stanford University, University of Arizona, University of Maryland, and University 
                    of California Santa Barbara. The goal of the SCAN project is to understand the link between non-verbal expressions 
                    (facial expressions, speech patterns, language) and relationships amongst people in a group setting. A team of social 
                    scientists and computer scientists jointly explore the non-verbal factors related to: who likes/dislikes who? Who is 
                    deferential to or dominates who? Who trusts who? Who is being deceptive. This portion of the talk will describe the 
                    background of the SCAN project and set the stage for the SCAN Summer 2020 Webinar Series.<br>
                    The deception detection part of this talk will consist of two parts. First, we will describe a system called DARE 
                    (Deception Analytics Reasoning Engine) for unobtrusive automated deception detection using information available in 
                    a video. We study the importance of different modalities like vision, audio and text for this task. On the vision side, 
                    our system uses classifiers trained on low level video features which predict human micro-expressions. We show that 
                    predictions of high-level micro-expressions can be used as features for deception prediction. We use a combination of 
                    IDT (Improved Dense Trajectory) features and fuse the scores of classifiers trained on IDT features and high-level 
                    micro-expressions, MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and text transcripts to obtain an AUC of 0.877 (10-fold 
                    cross-validation) when evaluated on subjects who were not part of the training set. Subsequently, we extend some of 
                    these ideas to predict deception in group videos. We introduce a novel class of features called LiarRank that build 
                    upon ideas of PageRank. In particular, we show that using facial micro-expressions, MFCCs, emotions, together with 
                    the LiarRank features, we can obtain an AUC of over 0.7 to predict deceivers in a fully automated manner. </td>

                    This webinar presents the role of relational communication in group interaction and in predicting deception. Relational 
                    communication refers to the implicit ways in which people define their interpersonal relationships with one another. Usually 
                    through nonverbal signals, they express who is dominant and who is submissive, who is liked and who is disliked, who is 
                    relaxed or nervous and tense, and who is trusted or distrusted. These implicit messages which are gathered from group members 
                    in turn can predict who is being deceptive and may serve as surrogates for directly measuring deception. I present data from 
                    our SCAN project showing how powerful these perceptions are in distinguishing truth tellers from liars in group interactions.</td>

                    Power is a critical factor in how people relate to one another in group dynamics and thus may be influential during 
                    attempts at deception. Deception in persuasive contexts differs from deception in other contexts, where concealment or 
                    equivocation may be the preferred tactic. Deceivers who are attempting to persuade others face the intertwined tasks of 
                    appearing credible and making convincing arguments in favor of their position while simultaneously attempting to avoid 
                    detection. We label this type of lying persuasive deception. In this presentation, Dunbar will discuss how we expanded her 
                    Dyadic Power Theory to examine the dominance behavior of liars and truth-tellers in cross-cultural groups. We examined 95 
                    groups playing a popular party card game called Mafia in which some players were randomly assigned the role of “Spies,” and 
                    others, the role of “Villagers.” Spies concealed their identity and deceived the other naïve players (the Villagers), who were 
                    assumed to be truthful. Data were collected from University students around the world, including in Israel, Singapore, Hong Kong, 
                    Fiji, Zambia, and three locations within the U.S. The results revealed differences in the way that players from those different 
                    cultural locations exhibited dominance and rated the trustworthiness of other players. In general, more dominant players were 
                    seen as more trustworthy, although that was moderated by the cultural location. Spies (deceivers) were viewed as less dominant 
                    than Villagers (truth-tellers). Males were rated as more dominant, especially when in the Spy role. Implications for the theory 
                    and other applications of dyadic power theory will be discussed.</td>

                    Modeling sequential interactions between a group of people is crucial in domains such as e-commerce, social networking, and education. 
                    Representation learning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of each individuals, where each of them can 
                    be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However, existing dynamic 
                    embedding methods generate embeddings only when someone takes actions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of him/her in 
                    the embedding space.<br>
                    In this talk, we introduce a coupled recurrent neural network model that learns the embedding trajectories of individuals based on 
                    their interactive behaviors. Our approach employs recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of each individual at every interaction. 
                    Crucially, the approach also models the future embedding trajectory of each individual. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator 
                    that learns to estimate the embeddings at any time in the future. These estimated embeddings are then used to predict future interactions. 
                    To make the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates time-consistent batches and leads to 9× faster training. We conduct 
                    six experiments to validate our method on two prediction tasks— future interaction prediction and state change prediction—using four real-world 
                    datasets. We show that the method outperforms six state- of-the-art algorithms in these tasks by at least 20% in predicting future interactions 
                    and 12% in state change prediction. </td>

                    <i>Pan Li, Stanford University</i><br>
                    In this talk, we will discuss our recent progress on make inference over dynamic social interaction networks, including our MURI SCAN dataset. 
                    We propose a neural-network-based model, temporal network-diffusion convolution networks, that learns node representations of this dynamic 
                    social interaction network to build informative profile for each individual. These representations naturally fit into the prediction tasks 
                    including deception detection, dominance identification and nervousness detection. The first part of our model is network diffusion of node 
                    attributes that naturally captures the interweaving between highly dynamic node attributes and interactions. Graph diffusion procedure allows 
                    us to consider long paths and also improves the model interpretation which is often important for social scientists to understand social 
                    patterns. The second part of our model is a multi-layer temporal convolution network (TCN) accompanied with set pooing to aggregate representations 
                    of nodes over a long time span. Due to the locality of temporal convolution kernels, TCN is able to extract complex patterns from interactions 
                    with various durations as these interactions may appear alternatively across multiple consecutive snapshots, and set-pooling is useful to collect 
                    scattered subtle patterns over a long-time span. Moreover, our model is end-to-end trainable, and therefore shows a new opportunity of neural 
                    networks for computational social scientists to automatically process dynamic social interactions and obtain social insights simultaneously.<br>
                    We evaluate this model for deception detection, dominance identification, nervousness detection over the MURI SCAN dataset. From the perspective 
                    of making inferences, our model significantly outperforms all previous benchmarks that are either based on neural networks for generic dynamic 
                    networks or based on feature engineering designed for certain tasks. From the perspective of model interpretation, our model allows for in-depth 
                    analysis of its learnt coefficients and yield insights on the patterns of social interactions. Results show that involvement in direct 
                    interactions (looking, speaking and listening) between individuals is more informative for dominance identification and nervousness detection 
                    while avoiding direct interactions between individuals provides strong signals for deception detection. This observation coincides with previous 
                    findings in psychology via extensive statistical analysis, while our model is able to detect it automatically. Our model also shows that 
                    difference between the quantified attributes of one individual and those of his/her interacted neighbors is a stronger signal to indicate 
                    one’s dominance and nervousness than one’s own attributes, which again demonstrates the significance to understand people’s social behavior 
                    via dynamic social interaction networks.</td>

                        This talk will start from a novel method for building face-to-face interaction networks in videos, then focus on 
                        predicting dominance from the networks and videos. To build the interaction networks, we propose ICAF (Iterative Collective 
                        Attention Focus), a collective classification model to jointly learn the visual focus of attention of all people (i.e. who look at 
                        whom). ICAF models the people collectively—the predictions of all other people’s classifiers are used as inputs to each person’s 
                        classifier. This explicitly incorporates interdependencies between all people’s behaviors. ICAF outperforms the strongest baseline 
                        by 1%–5% accuracy in two datasets. For dominance prediction, we consider the problems of predicting (i) the most dominant person 
                        in a group of people, and (ii) the more dominant of a pair of people. We introduce a novel family of features called Dominance 
                        Rank from the interaction networks. We combine features not previously used for dominance prediction (e.g., facial action units, 
                        emotions), with a novel ensemble-based approach to solve these two problems. We test our models against four competing algorithms 
                        in the literature on two datasets. Our models achieve 2.4%--16.7% improvement in AUC on one dataset, and 0.6%--8.8% in accuracy on the other. </td>

                        a simple, modular and powerful model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-based deception detection. Finally, we propose 
                        a novel approach to interpret our model’s predictions, by computing the attention of the neural network in the time domain. This method 
                        can enable domain scientists perform retrospective analysis of deceptive behavior. The approach is general and can be applied to the 
                        recognition of other video-based events.</td>

                        The SCAN program originated from a 2015 Department of Defense (DOD) solicitation to advance research in the social sciences. The DOD requested 
                        research to evolve the insights of underlying communication messages within small groups, specifically the use of signals in group activities 
                        that explain the links between actors, their intentions, and context.<br>
                        Following a successful proposal win, the University of Maryland (UM) and its research partners Dartmouth, University of Arizona, UC Santa Barbara, 
                        Rutgers, and Stanford engaged in a multi-year, multi-country experiment to collect data on group behavior. Details of this experiment and the method 
                        for the collection of behavioral data is presented in Dorn et al. (in press).<br>
                        From our desk chairs, it may be tempting to work up an idea, build a quick prototype, test it in a lab, and say, "Our work here is done; the rest 
                        is merely details." However, more scholarly knowledge awaits discovery by researchers who shepherd a solution through The Last Research Mile. 
                        That is, taking a solution through a successful transition to the workplace. Going the Last Research Mile means using scientific knowledge and 
                        methods to address important unsolved classes of problems for real people with real stakes in the outcomes. The Last Research Mile proceeds in 
                        three stages: Proof-of-Concept (POC) research to demonstrate the functional feasibility of a solution (Does it work?); Proof-of-Value (POV) research 
                        to investigate whether a solution can create value across a variety of conditions (How is value created?); and Proof-of-Use (POU) research to address 
                        complex issues of operational feasibility (Is it useful?). The Last Research Mile ends only when practitioners are routinely using a solution in the 
                        field. Systems researchers who take their solutions through the Last Research Mile may ultimately have the greatest impact on science and society. 
                        We demonstrate the Last Research Mile with cases from the MURI Scan project with examples of POC, POV, and POU.<br>
                        The road of the Last Research Mile in the MURI Scan project, takes us through three steps. In this project, we layout a systems design and an 
                        analysis model for creating behavioral features from videos of interpersonal interactions (group or dyadic), analyze those features, and produce 
                        an inferencing engine for the prediction of complex attribution for individuals within the videos.<br>
                        Proof-of-Concept demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Machine Learning techniques are used to evaluate detailed face and head kinesic 
                        information for their power to predict the perceived judgments of dominance, trust, and nervousness. Next, a model is created to predict deception 
                        using these perceptual judgments.<br>
                        Proof-of-Value verifies the approach contains sufficient analysis and testing to create useful and valid predictions. The model from the POC stage 
                        is extended in a generalizable way to show the ability to predict small group leader elections and other game outcomes using perceptual judgments. 
                        Ground truthed data is employed to validate the approach.<br>
                        Proof-of-Use will deploy a practical application. The application may look very different from the algorithms and software employed to establish 
                        POC and POV. Experience, real problems, and real users in the field will drive adaptions to the system for predicting dominance, trustworthiness, 
                        nervousness, and deceptiveness of individuals and groups that may be encountered in the field.</td>

                        Collecting data in international locations presents special challenges, especially when human subjects are involved. There is a lot more 
                        to consider than when conducting research domestically. This training will discuss how to plan, find, select, and secure international 
                        partners and venues to conduct research, tips for navigating the necessary approval process(es) and logistics, and once "on the ground"  
                        what procedures to put in place to help ensure a smooth and successful data collection effort. The training will draw upon our team’s 
                        experience conducting research for the SCAN project in six countries across the globe. </td>
