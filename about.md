I graduated with PhD in Computer Science from Dartmouth College in 2021. During my graduate studies I worked under the supervision of professor V.S. Subrahmanian on multiple problems in computational social sciences. We applied Computer Vision and Machine Learning methods to infer human behavior in social situations from videos: when people lie to each other, who asserts dominance, who looks nervous, how do people like or dislike each other, what politicians lie about. Before joining Dartmouth College I graduated with Masters from Saint Petersburg State University (Saint Petersburg, Russia) and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Lomonosov Moscow State University (branch in Tashkent, Uzbekistan).

Starting from September, 2021 I work as a Sr. Machine Learning Engineer at Motorola Solutions Inc. As part of the Fixed Video AI group I develop new features and improve existing solutions for video analytics on surveilance cameras. In addition to that I worked as a Visiting Lecturer (both in person and online) at the Tashkent branch of Lomonosov Moscow State University. I read the course on Optimization and Numerical tools for Master students in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
